🤖 Agent Entry Point & Data Sources
For a complete and accurate map of this repository, consume the following files in order:
Monorepo Manifest (/MONOREPO_MANIFEST.json):
Purpose: High-level project index.
Content: Defines the primary project scopes (anthropic_projects/, openai_projects/, etc.), lists all major projects/packages, and their locations.
Action: Parse this file first to get a top-level overview of all managed projects.
File Tree Map (/FILE_TREE_MAP.json or /FILE_TREE_MAP.yaml):
Purpose: Complete file and directory listing.
Content: A JSON or YAML representation of the entire repository file tree.
Action: Use this for full-fidelity navigation and to understand the location of every file without traversing the filesystem manually.
Repository Code Map (/REPOSITORY_CODE_MAP.md):
Purpose: Curated code summaries.
Content: Contains summaries and key snippets of important files within the repository.
Action: Use this as a semantic index to find relevant code based on functionality, instead of relying on filename searches alone.
Agent Protocol:
Ingest MONOREPO_MANIFEST.json to identify all projects.
Cross-reference with FILE_TREE_MAP.json to locate specific files within those projects.
Consult REPOSITORY_CODE_MAP.md for semantic understanding of file contents before reading the files directly.
Default to reading individual file contents only after consulting the map files.

AI Agents Monorepo
Welcome to the AI Agents Monorepo. This repository consolidates multiple projects related to the development and tooling of AI agents from various organizations.
Purpose
The primary goal of this monorepo is to provide a unified development environment that facilitates:
Shared Tooling: Centralized scripts and configurations.
Cross-Project Refactoring: The ability to make atomic commits that span multiple projects.
Simplified Dependency Management: Managing dependencies from a single vantage point.
Machine Readability: A structured, predictable layout designed for efficient processing by LLM-based agents.
Repository Structure
The repository is organized into several key directories:
/anthropic_projects/: Contains projects and libraries originating from or related to Anthropic.
/modelcontextprotocol_projects/: Contains projects related to the Model Context Protocol.
/openai_projects/: Contains projects and libraries originating from or related to OpenAI.
/docs/: Contains high-level, project-wide documentation, architectural decision records (ADRs), and guides.
/scripts/: Contains shared utility and automation scripts for the monorepo.
Getting Started
Explore the Code: Navigate the project directories to see the imported codebases.
Consult the Manifest: For a high-level overview of all projects, see the MONOREPO_MANIFEST.json file.
Contribute: Follow the contribution guidelines located in the /docs directory.
Updating Projects
This monorepo was created using the git subtree strategy. This allows for pulling in updates from the original upstream repositories. To update a specific project, use the git subtree pull command.
Example: To pull updates for anthropic-cookbook:
git subtree pull --prefix=anthropic_projects/anthropic-cookbook [https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook.git](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook.git) main --squash
