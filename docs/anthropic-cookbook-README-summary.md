The Anthropic Cookbook repository offers sample code snippets and guides for building with Claude, Anthropic's LLM. It assumes users have an Anthropic API key and primarily targets Python but the ideas apply broadly. The README highlights prerequisites, points newcomers to other educational materials, and encourages contributions via issues and pull requests. Links to Anthropic docs, support resources, and community channels provide additional learning paths.
