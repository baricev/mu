This project provides a minimal MCP server example aimed at deep research use cases, demonstrating how to search and fetch cupcake orders. The README explains how to create a Python virtual environment, install dependencies, and run the sample server, which listens on localhost using server-sent events. It also lists the main files in the repository, such as the `sample_mcp.py` entry point and a data file containing example records.
