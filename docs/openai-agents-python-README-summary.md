The OpenAI Agents SDK for Python provides a framework for building agent workflows that integrate with the OpenAI API and other LLMs. The README introduces key concepts such as agents, handoffs, guardrails, sessions, and tracing. It walks through setup steps, showing how to install the SDK, create a simple agent, and manage conversation state with session objects. Further sections explain the agent loop, provide examples using functions and handoffs, and detail development instructions for contributors including linting, testing, and documentation generation.
