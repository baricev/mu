The Anthropic Python SDK gives programmatic access to the Anthropic API for Python 3.8+. It includes typed request and response objects and provides synchronous and asynchronous clients via httpx, with optional aiohttp for better concurrency. Installation is via `pip install anthropic`. The README contains sample code for creating messages, using AsyncAnthropic, and managing API keys securely.
