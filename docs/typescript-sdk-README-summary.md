The MCP TypeScript SDK provides tools for building servers and clients that follow the Model Context Protocol. The README outlines installation via npm, a quickstart, and in-depth explanations of core MCP concepts like resources, tools, prompts, and completions. Examples demonstrate different server configurations, from stdin/stdout servers to streamable HTTP endpoints. Advanced sections cover dynamic servers and proxying authorization requests. The document serves as a comprehensive guide for TypeScript developers adopting MCP.
