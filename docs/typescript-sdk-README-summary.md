The MCP TypeScript SDK provides tools to build MCP clients and servers in Node.js. It requires Node 18+ and can be installed via `npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. The README explains core concepts (servers, resources, tools, prompts) and includes a quickstart demonstrating how to register a calculator tool and dynamic resource. Advanced sections cover dynamic servers, low-level APIs, writing MCP clients, proxying auth requests, and compatibility.
