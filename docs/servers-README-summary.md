The Model Context Protocol Servers repository collects reference server implementations demonstrating how MCP can securely connect LLMs to tools and data. The README lists server examples—such as Everything, Git, Memory, and Sequential Thinking—each implemented with various official MCP SDKs. It maintains links to community servers, encourages alphabetical ordering for new entries, and includes an extensive contributing guide. This serves as a central hub for exploring and building MCP servers.
